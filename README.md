# **Installation Guide for Streamlit, LangChain, and ChatGroq**  

This guide will help you set up the required dependencies and install the necessary Python packages to run this project successfully.  

## **Prerequisites**  
Before installing the dependencies, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:  

- **Python** (version 3.8 or later)  
- **pip** (Python package manager)  
- **Git** (for cloning the repository, if needed)  

To check if you have Python and pip installed, run the following commands:  

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

## **Step 1: Clone the Repository (Optional)**  
If you haven't already cloned this repository, you can do so using:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

## **Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment**  
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with global Python packages.  

### **On Windows (Command Prompt / PowerShell):**  

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **On macOS/Linux (Terminal):**  

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Once activated, your terminal should show `(venv)` at the beginning of the command line.

## **Step 3: Upgrade pip**  
Before installing the packages, upgrade `pip` to the latest version:  

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

## **Step 4: Install Dependencies**  
### **Option 1: Install from `requirements.txt` (Recommended)**  
If your project includes a `requirements.txt` file, you can install all dependencies with:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Option 2: Manually Install Required Packages**  
If you prefer installing packages manually, use the following command:  

```bash
pip install streamlit langchain chatgroq PyMuPDF Pillow python-dotenv json
```

## **Step 5: Verify Installation**  
To ensure everything is installed correctly, you can check installed packages with:  

```bash
pip list
```

## **Step 6: Running the Application**  
Once the installation is complete, you can start the application by running:  

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

(Replace `app.py` with your actual script name if different.)  

## **Troubleshooting**  
- If you encounter any issues, try reinstalling dependencies inside a fresh virtual environment.  
- Ensure your Python version is compatible (3.8 or later).  
- If a package fails to install, check the error messages and install any missing system dependencies.
